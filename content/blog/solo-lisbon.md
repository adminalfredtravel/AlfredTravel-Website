Solo travel in Lisbon means **you** set the pace—but most “solo Lisbon” guides don’t. They hand you the same packed day as the couple from Ohio. **Alfred Travel** builds **personalized** itineraries: activity gating, optional siesta blocks, and transit validation so your Lisbon plan fits a human, not a brochure.

## Comparison Table: Generic vs. Alfred Solo Logic

| Factor | Generic solo “guide” | Alfred Travel |
|--------|------------------------|----------------|
| Daily capacity | Same as group itineraries | Gated: 2–3 anchors + flex; no 12-stop marathons |
| Transit | “Take tram 28” (no timing) | Validated tram/train legs and realistic walk times |
| Pace | Fixed | Configurable (relaxed / balanced / packed) |
| Multi-day | Disconnected | One itinerary, sleep/energy continuity |

We don’t just suggest “Alfama in the morning.” We **validate** that Alfama → Belém (or LX Factory) is feasible in the time you have and gate how much we add so you’re not exhausted by 3 p.m.

## What You Get in This Plan

- **Neighborhood sequencing:** Alfama, Baixa, Belém, and/or LX Factory in an order that makes sense for tram and foot.
- **Meal and rest slots:** Built in so the plan survives real-world energy.
- **Optional extensions:** Sintra or Cascais as validated add-ons, not afterthoughts.

**Alfred** is the only AI planner that combines **logistical validation** with **personalization**—so your solo Lisbon is yours, and it’s executable.
