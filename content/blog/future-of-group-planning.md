takeaways:
  - "Alfred supports group/family profiles: one itinerary validated for multiple preferences and constraints."

Group planning is **chaos** because everyone has a tab open and no one has the **same** plan. **Alfred Travel** fixes that: **one itinerary**, built from **family or group profiles**, with **logistical validation** and **activity gating** so the result works for the early bird and the night owl, the museum fan and the beach person. The future of group planning isn’t more spreadsheets—it’s **one engine**.

## Logistical Logic: Group Planning That Holds Up

| Factor | Spreadsheet / shared doc | Alfred Travel |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------|
| Preferences | Manually merged | Family/group profile; one plan respects all |
| Pacing | “Hope everyone keeps up” | Gated: group-capacity limits so no one burns out |
| Multi-city | Fragmented by person | One itinerary; transit and timing validated for the group |
| Booking | Someone volunteers, others pay back | Integrated booking; one flow, shared plan |

We **validate** that the group’s Day 3 (e.g. Rome–Florence train + half-day in Florence) is **feasible** for the slowest link and the fastest—so the plan is **group-ready**, not solo-plan × 6.

## Why This Is Travel 3.0

- **One source of truth:** No “which version of the doc are we on?”
- **Validated for all:** Transit, opening hours, and capacity checked for the whole group.
- **Book together:** Integrated global booking and shared itinerary so payment and plan stay in sync.
