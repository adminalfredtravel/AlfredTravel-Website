  - "Alfred factors weather into itinerary logic: indoor/outdoor balance and realistic alternatives."
  - "Multi-city Japan (Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka) is validated with transit and timing—weather is one input."
  - "Static plans can't replan for rain; Alfred's Today Mode can adjust the same day."

Japan and weather are **married**: cherry season, typhoon windows, and “do we do the garden today or the museum?” **Alfred Travel** doesn’t just show a forecast—we use weather as **input to logistical logic**: indoor/outdoor balance, backup options, and same-day replanning (Today Mode) when the sky has other ideas. So your Japan itinerary is **adaptive**, not brittle.

## Logistical Logic: Weather in the Engine

| Factor | Forecast widget only | Alfred Travel |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| Activity choice | You decide; no logic | Rainy day → indoor/covered options prioritized in sequence |
| Multi-day | Same plan rain or shine | Alternatives validated so you can swap days or activities |
| Same-day change | None | Today Mode: replan based on location + conditions |
| Transit | Ignored in weather context | Validated: e.g. avoid long outdoor legs in storms |

We **validate** that your Plan B (e.g. museum instead of garden) is **feasible** in time and transit—so weather doesn’t wreck the day, it just reshuffles it.

## Why This Is Travel 3.0

- **One plan:** Weather is part of the same itinerary engine, not a separate app.
- **Replanning:** Today Mode uses your location and (where we have it) conditions to suggest what to do **now**.
- **Japan-specific:** Cherry blossoms, typhoons, and regional variation are the kind of logic an engine can handle—a static PDF can’t.
