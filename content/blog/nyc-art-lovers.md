NYC for art lovers is a **scheduling puzzle**: MoMA, Met, Whitney, galleries in Chelsea and the LES—each with its own hours and location. **Alfred Travel** solves it with **transit validation** and **activity gating**: we don’t give you four museums in one day, and we don’t suggest a Brooklyn–UES–Chelsea zigzag that burns half your day on the subway.

## Logistical Logic: NYC Art Without the Chaos

| Factor | Generic NYC “art guide” | Alfred Travel |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------|
| Museum hours | Often wrong or ignored | Checked; we don’t send you to a closed Met |
| Subway/walk time | Guessed | Validated legs so neighborhood order makes sense |
| Density per day | “10 must-sees” | Gated: 1–2 major museums + 1–2 galleries or walks |
| Same-day changes | None | Today Mode: replan based on where you are |

We **validate** that your MoMA → Whitney (or Met → Frick) sequence fits opening hours and realistic travel time—so you see art, not just subway cars.

## What This Itinerary Delivers

- **Day blocks:** UES (Met, Frick, etc.), Midtown (MoMA), Chelsea galleries, LES/Brooklyn—each with validated transit and hours.
- **Rest and food:** Slotted so the plan doesn’t assume you’re a robot.
- **Optional:** One “flex” half-day for replanning with Today Mode when you’re on the ground.

**Alfred** is the only AI that treats NYC art as **logistics**—hours, transit, gating—so your trip is Travel 3.0, not list 1.0.
