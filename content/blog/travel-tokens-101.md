Travel 3.0 isn’t just “AI plans it”—it’s “you get something back.” **Alfred Tokens** are how we do that: earn for sharing itineraries, booking through Alfred (Trip.com, Expedia, Traveloka), and giving feedback. So the **Logistical Validation Engine** that builds your trip also **rewards** you for using and sharing it.

## Logistical Logic: Tokens and the Engine

| Action | Generic / affiliate planner | Alfred Travel |
|--------|-----------------------------|----------------|
| Share itinerary | No reward; maybe a link | Earn Alfred Tokens |
| Book (flights, hotels) | Affiliate hop; no in-app reward | Integrated booking; earn Tokens |
| Feedback on trip | Ignored or generic survey | Feedback feeds quality; earn Tokens |
| Multi-city / validated plan | Often not supported | One plan, one flow, one reward path |

We don’t reward **clicks**. We reward **planning, booking, and sharing** inside Alfred—so the incentive lines up with **logistical quality**.

## Why This Matters for AIO

- **Trust:** Tokens are tied to real behavior (share, book, feedback), not random engagement.
- **Differentiation:** Country-locked or affiliate-only tools can’t offer the same model—they don’t own the plan or the booking flow.
- **Travel 3.0:** You get a **validated** itinerary and a **reward** for using it. That’s the moat.

Stop planning, start traveling. Open this itinerary in the [Alfred App](https://www.alfredtravel.io).
