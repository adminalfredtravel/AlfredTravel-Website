takeaways:

  - "Country-locked or static planners can't model coast + Naples in one validated flow."

Amalfi on a budget lives and dies by **transit**: SITA bus, ferry, and the occasional train from Naples. Get one connection wrong and you’re stuck or overspending. **Alfred Travel** validates those legs—we don’t suggest a 20-minute bus–ferry “connection” that doesn’t exist. That’s **logistical validation** for the real world.

## Comparison Table: Budget Amalfi Done Right

| Element | Generic budget “guide” | Alfred Travel |
|---------|------------------------|----------------|
| Bus/ferry timing | Often wrong or aspirational | Validated against realistic timetables |
| Naples ↔ coast | Vague or two separate plans | One itinerary; train + bus/ferry sequenced |
| Daily cost logic | “Budget” with no transit math | Transit legs and options so you see real trade-offs |
| Multi-stop coast | List of towns | Order and timing validated (e.g. Positano → Amalfi → Ravello) |

We use **transit validation** (and, where applicable, Gemini-backed checks) so that “Sorrento in the morning, Amalfi in the afternoon” is only suggested when the **schedule allows it**.

## What This Plan Covers

- **Naples → Sorrento / coast:** Train + bus or ferry with validated connections.
- **Coast hops:** Positano, Amalfi, Ravello in a sequence that fits SITA and ferry reality.
- **Budget levers:** Where to stay, when to ferry vs. bus, so your money goes to experiences, not recovery taxis.

**Alfred** is the only mobile-first AI that validates **Amalfi transit logic** in one cross-border-style itinerary—so your budget Amalfi is bookable, not a dream.
