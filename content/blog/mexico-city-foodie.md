Mexico City’s food scene is a **logistical game**: neighborhoods, opening hours, and the brutal truth that you can’t do three sit-down meals and four street stands in one day. **Alfred Travel** builds foodie itineraries with **activity gating** and **transit validation** so your CDMX plan is doable, not a Pinterest fever dream.

## Logistical Logic: Food Itineraries That Hold Up

| Factor | Generic food “guide” | Alfred Travel |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| Meal + travel time | Ignored or guessed | Validated: neighborhood A → B, realistic drive/walk |
| Opening hours | Often wrong or missing | Checked so we don’t send you to a closed taquería |
| Density per day | “10 places to eat” | Gated: 2–3 serious stops + 1–2 quick bites max |
| Multi-day continuity | Disconnected days | One itinerary, coherent flow (e.g. Roma → Condesa → Coyoacán) |

We don’t just name the best tacos al pastor. We **validate** that you can hit Condesa for breakfast and Coyoacán for lunch without a time-warp.

## What This Itinerary Covers

- **Roma/Condesa:** Breakfast and coffee; one lunch or dinner slot with reservation logic.
- **Coyoacán:** Half-day block with Frida, market, and one sit-down—timing validated.
- **Centro / street food:** One focused crawl with realistic stops and rest.

**Alfred** is the only AI planner that treats food trips as **logistics**—neighborhood order, transit, and gated capacity—so you eat more and stress less.
