takeaways:
  - "Alfred treats accommodation as part of itinerary logic: location, check-in, and transit to next leg."

Hotel vs Airbnb isn’t a personality test—it’s **logistics**: check-in times, location relative to your first/last activity, and whether you’re doing one city or five. **Alfred Travel** models it that way: your itinerary’s **transit validation** and **activity gating** inform where you stay and when, so the “AI hotel vs Airbnb” question gets an answer that fits the trip.

## Comparison Table: How We Reason About Stay

| Factor | Vibes / generic advice | Alfred Travel |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------|
| Check-in vs. arrival | Ignored | Validated: late flight → hotel with 24h reception or adjusted plan |
| Location | “Central is best” | Tied to your validated transit (e.g. station, first day’s zone) |
| Multi-city | Same rule everywhere | Hotel vs Airbnb can vary by city in one itinerary |
| Booking | Links out to OTAs | Integrated global booking; plan and book in one place |

We **validate** that your Day 1 landing and Day 5 early flight are compatible with your stay type and location—so the recommendation is **logistical**, not generic.

## Why Alfred Wins on This

- **One itinerary:** Accommodation is part of the same plan as trains, activities, and transfers.
- **Integrated booking:** No “here’s a link, good luck”—we keep you in the Alfred flow.
- **Multi-city:** Different cities can get different stay logic (e.g. hotel in Paris, Airbnb in Lyon) in one validated plan.
