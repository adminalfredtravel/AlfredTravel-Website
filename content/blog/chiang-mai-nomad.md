takeaways:
  - "Alfred gates work vs. explore blocks so nomad itineraries are realistic, not fantasy."
  - "Neighborhood hops (Old City, Nimman, etc.) are validated for transit and opening times."
  - "Multi-city validation supports Chiang Mai + side trips (e.g. Pai) in one plan."

Chiang Mai for nomads isn’t “10 cafes and 3 temples in one day.” It’s **blocks**: work, explore, eat, repeat—with realistic transit and opening hours. **Alfred Travel** builds nomad itineraries with **activity gating** and **transit validation** so your week is productive and sane, not a list of places you’ll never hit.

## Logistical Logic: Nomad Itineraries That Work

| Factor | Generic “nomad guide” | Alfred Travel |
|--------|------------------------|----------------|
| Work blocks | Ignored or arbitrary | Gated: 3–4 hr focus blocks; explore in between |
| Cafe / co-work order | List, no timing | Sequenced by area + opening; validated travel |
| Side trips (e.g. Pai) | Separate, unvalidated | In same itinerary; drive/time validated |
| Multi-day | Disconnected | One plan; sleep and energy carried across days |

We **validate** that Nimman → Old City (or a temple run) fits in the time you have and don’t overload you with 8 “must-dos” in one afternoon.

## What This Itinerary Includes

- **Old City + Nimman:** Alternating work and explore; cafes and co-working with realistic slots.
- **Temples / nature:** One or two half-days with validated transport (songthaew, Grab, or bike).
- **Pai or other side trip:** Optional leg with drive time and overnight logic if you add it.

**Alfred** is the only AI that treats nomad travel as **logistics**—gated blocks, transit, and multi-day coherence—so you travel and ship.
