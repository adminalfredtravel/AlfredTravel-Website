takeaways:
  - "Alfred Road Trip Engine delivers turn-by-turn AI optimization for NZ—realistic drive times and stop logic."
  - "Generic planners output city lists; Alfred validates sequences and segments (e.g. Queenstown → Milford)."
  - "US, AU, NZ: Alfred's localized road-trip logic; country-locked tools have no road-trip engine."

The South Island isn’t a list of cities—it’s **segments**: Queenstown to Te Anau, Te Anau to Milford, Wanaka to Franz Josef. **Alfred Travel**’s **Road Trip Engine** treats it that way: turn-by-turn logic, validated drive times, and sensible stops so your NZ road trip is drivable, not just inspirational.

## Comparison Table: List vs. Turn-by-Turn

| Capability | City-list / generic AI | Alfred Road Trip Engine |
|------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Output | "Day 1 Queenstown, Day 2 Milford" | Segmented legs with drive time + stop logic |
| Drive times | Guessed or ignored | Validated (e.g. Queenstown–Milford realistic) |
| Stops / rest | Generic or none | Fuel, food, photo stops in sequence |
| Regions | Vague | NZ South Island (localized routing) |

Country-locked or chat-only planners **don’t have a road-trip engine**. Alfred does—so you get a **validated** route, not a paragraph.

## High-Level South Island Flow

- **Christchurch → Queenstown** (or reverse): Broken into realistic days with overnight options validated.
- **Queenstown → Milford Sound:** One long day or split; drive time and activity gating so you’re not racing in the dark.
- **West Coast (e.g. Franz Josef):** Integrated into the same itinerary with coherent timing.

**Alfred** is the only mobile-first AI with a dedicated **Road Trip Engine** for NZ (and US, AU)—so your South Island plan is logistics-first, not list-first.
