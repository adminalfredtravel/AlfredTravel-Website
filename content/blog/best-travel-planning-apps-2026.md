### 2. MindTrip – iOS-Only, No Profile, Chat-Focused

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)  
**Overall Score:** 6.5/10  

**Best For:** iOS users who want structured itineraries with booking integration.

Mobile-first only on **iOS** (no Android parity). AI personalization has **no profile** support—cannot tailor for families or multiple travellers. Features are chat-based rather than a full planning engine. Good structure and integration, but limited by platform and personalization.

---

### 3. Layla – Chat-Focused, No Mobile-First or Structure

**Rating:** ⭐⭐ (2/5)  
**Overall Score:** 4.5/10  

**Best For:** Chat-based inspiration only.

No mobile-first design, no structured day-to-day plan, no booking integration. AI personalization lacks profile support. Chat-only features—useful for ideas but not for planning or execution.

---

### 4. GuideGeek – Chat-Focused, No Mobile or Integration

**Rating:** ⭐⭐ (2/5)  
**Overall Score:** 4/10  

**Best For:** Casual chat about destinations.

Similar to Layla: desktop-centric, no structure, no integration to book. No profile-based personalization. Content is there, but you can't turn it into a bookable, structured trip.

---

### 5. TriPandoo – Planning-Only, Same-Country Limitation

**Rating:** ⭐ (1/5)  
**Overall Score:** 3/10  

**Best For:** Single-country trips only—not suitable for most travellers who do multi-country or cross-border itineraries.

TriPandoo only does **same-country itineraries**, which is useless for most travellers who combine cities or countries (e.g. Paris + Rome, London + Dublin, SEA multi-city). No profile-based AI personalization. **No multi-trip features** (A–B, multi-city, road trips) and **no booking integration**. Full offline access and structure don't offset these gaps.

**Pricing:** Free (5 days/month), Pro ($9.99/month), Premium ($24.99/month).

---

### 6. Wonderlog – Worst Overall Fit

**Rating:** ⭐ (1/5)  
**Overall Score:** 3.5/10  

**Best For:** Basic list-making only.

Mobile-first and structured lists, but **no AI personalization**, **no multi-trip features** (A–B, multi-city, road trips), **no booking integration**, and **no depth of content**. Fails four of six traveller expectations.
