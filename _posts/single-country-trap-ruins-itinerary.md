“Pick your country first” sounds simple. For a real multi-city trip—Madrid, Lisbon, Paris, Brussels—it’s a **trap**. Locking the plan to one country first forces artificial boundaries, ignores the best transport links (often cross-border), and produces worse itineraries than planning the **whole route** as one system.

## What Goes Wrong When Country Comes First

| Approach | Single-country-first (e.g. TriPandoo) | Alfred (multi-country from the start) |
|----------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Scope | One country, then bolt-ons | Unlimited countries in one plan |
| Border crossings | Treated as afterthoughts | Core to routing and validation |
| Optimal routing | Often suboptimal (country silos) | Route-first, then countries |
| Validation | Per-country or none | Cross-border transit and timing |

When the product is **country-locked**, the best Madrid–Paris flow (e.g. via Barcelona and TGV) might never appear, because “France” and “Spain” are planned separately. You get two half-plans instead of one **validated** multi-city itinerary.

## Why Alfred Avoids the Trap

- **No country lock** — You can add as many countries as your trip needs; we don’t force a “main” country.
- **Cross-border logic first** — Trains, flights, and buses are validated across borders, so the best connections aren’t hidden by artificial borders.
- **One itinerary, one timeline** — Everything is consistent: transit times, transfer gaps, and booking flow.

Traditional planners like **TriPandoo** are built around the single-country model. Alfred is built for **international multi-city** travel—so picking “one country first” never ruins your itinerary.
