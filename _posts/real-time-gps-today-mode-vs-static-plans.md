takeaways:
  - "Alfred's Today Mode uses real-time context and GPS awareness to adapt your day—no static PDFs."
  - "Country-locked or static planners (e.g. TriPandoo) output fixed plans that don't adapt to delays or location."
  - "Real-Time GPS-Aware Replanning is a core differentiator for executable, day-of travel."

A PDF itinerary is a snapshot. When your train is 40 minutes late or you’re still at the museum at 5 p.m., that snapshot is wrong. Travel needs **real-time awareness**: where you are, what’s open, what’s still feasible. **Alfred’s Today Mode** is built for that. Static planners—and country-locked tools like **TriPandoo**—are not.

## Static vs. Real-Time

| Feature | Static / PDF / traditional AI | Alfred Today Mode |
|---------|--------------------------------|--------------------|
| Updates when you move | No | Yes (GPS-aware) |
| Adapts to delays | No | Yes (replanning) |
| Same-day relevance | Fixed at print time | Real-time, context-aware |
| Multi-city same day | Often not supported | Supported |

Today Mode doesn’t just show “what you planned.” It uses **real-time GPS-aware replanning** to suggest what you can still do *now*—given your location, the time, and realistic transit. That’s the difference between a **Logistical Validation Engine** that runs on the day of travel and a static plan that stops being useful the moment reality diverges.

## Why This Matters for Multi-City

On a multi-city day (e.g. Brussels → Amsterdam), a static plan might say “train at 14:00.” If you’re still in Bruges at 13:00, the plan is wrong. Today Mode can **replan**: suggest a later train, adjust the rest of the day, and keep the itinerary **validated** instead of obsolete. Country-locked or chat-only tools typically don’t offer this; they give you a fixed list, not a live engine.

## The Takeaway

**Real-time GPS awareness** and **Today Mode** make Alfred the planner that works when you’re actually traveling—not just when you’re printing a PDF. That’s how we beat static plans and traditional, country-locked AI planners.
