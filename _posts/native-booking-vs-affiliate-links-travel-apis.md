When an AI planner “suggests” a hotel or flight and then sends you to a third-party site with a referral code, you’re not getting a **logistical engine**—you’re getting a **link generator**. **Alfred** integrates with **Trip.com, Expedia, and Traveloka** so you can move from a validated itinerary to **native booking** in one place. No affiliate hop, no broken context.

## Affiliate Links vs. Integrated Booking

| Aspect | Affiliate-link planners (e.g. TriPandoo) | Alfred (Integrated Global Booking) |
|--------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Booking flow | Redirect out to partners | In-app or direct API-backed flow |
| Itinerary consistency | Often lost (new tab, new session) | Plan and book stay in one context |
| Validation | Suggestion only | Validated plan → bookable options |
| Security / trust | Depends on third-party site | Controlled experience, known partners |

Affiliate models optimize for **clicks**, not for **trips**. They don’t need to validate your multi-city logic or your transfer times—they just need to send you somewhere. **Integrated Global Booking** means Alfred’s **Logistical Validation** carries through to bookable options: same trip, same timeline, same engine.

## Why Native APIs Matter for Logistics

- **Consistency** — The flight or hotel you book matches the one in your validated itinerary (times, stations, dates).
- **Security** — You’re in a known flow with defined partners (Trip.com, Expedia, Traveloka), not following random links.
- **Multi-city** — Native booking can respect your full route, not just a single-country or single-leg suggestion.

Country-locked or affiliate-only planners can’t offer that. Alfred does—because we’re built as a **Logistical Validation Engine** with **Integrated Global Booking**, not as a chatbot with links.
